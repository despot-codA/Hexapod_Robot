# Hexapod_Robot
Developed a budget-friendly prototype of a hexapod robot for our final year major project.

What is a hexapod?

Hexapod robots, also known as hexapods or six-legged robots, are a type of mechanical robot with six legs or limbs. Inspired by the locomotion of insects, these robots are designed for stability and versatility. Their six legs allow them to move in various directions, making them well-suited for challenging terrains and rough environments. Hexapods can walk, crawl, or even climb over obstacles with ease.

These robots find applications in fields such as search and rescue, where their ability to navigate uneven and unstable surfaces can be invaluable. They are also used in industrial automation for tasks like welding or inspection, where precise and flexible movement is required. Additionally, hexapods have been employed in scientific research and education to study biomechanics and robotics. Their adaptable design and locomotion capabilities make hexapod robots a fascinating area of robotics innovation.


# Project Overview in Brief
The comprehensive project involved design in SolidWorks, 3D printing, fabrication, coding, IoT integration, engineering calculations, kinematics, and structural and motion analysis through simulations. During the design phase, SolidWorks played a crucial role, allowing for the creation of detailed 3D models.

The 3D printing and fabrication stages transformed digital designs into physical objects, considering material choices and precision. Coding and IoT integration automated the project, enabling real-time data collection and internet connectivity for monitoring and control.

Engineering calculations were used to ensure structural integrity and functionality. Kinematics helped understand moving parts, facilitating the design of efficient mechanical systems. Structural and motion analysis through simulations identified and resolved issues before physical implementation, saving time and resources.
